# hotload
Hotload is a golang database/sql that supports dynamic reloading
of database configuration. In the typical use of sql.Open(), users must
close the returned DB object and recreate it to change the
connection string. Hotload works by registering a driver that proxies
the driver interface to the real database driver. When config changes
are detected it closes connections in a manner that causes the database/sql
package to create new connections with the new connection parameters.

```go
import (
    // import the std lib sql package
    "database/sql"

    log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"

    // this import registers hotload with the sql package
    "github.com/infobloxopen/hotload"

    // this import registers the fsnotify hotload strategy
    _ "github.com/infobloxopen/hotload/fsnotify"

    // this import registers the postgres driver with the sql package
    "github.com/lib/pq"
)

func init() {
    // this function call registers the lib/pq postgres driver with hotload
    hotload.Register("postgres", pq.Driver{})
}

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open("hotload", "fsnotify://postgres/tmp/myconfig.txt")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("could not open db connection: %s", err)
    }
    db.Query("select 1")
}
```
The above code:
* registers the hotload driver with database/sql
* registers the fsnotify strategy with hotload
* registers the lib/pq postgres driver with database/sql
* registers the lib/pq postgres driver with hotload

In the main() function, the sql.Open call uses the hotload driver. The URL for the
connection string specifies fsnotify in the scheme. This is the hotload strategy. The
hostname in the URL specifies the real database driver. Finally, the path and query parameters
are left for the hotload strategy plugin to configure themselves. Below is an example
of a lib/pq Postgres connection string that would have been stored at /tmp/myconfig.txt
```
user=pqgotest dbname=pqgotest sslmode=verify-full
```

# Strategies

Hotload has an interface for adding reload strategies. The interface looks like this:
```go
// Strategy is the plugin interface for hotload.
type Strategy interface {
	// Watch returns back the contents of the resource as well as a channel
	// for subsequent updates (if the value has changed). If there is an error
	// getting the initial value, an error is returned.
	Watch(ctx context.Context, pth string, options url.Values) (value string, values <-chan string, err error)
}
```

The strategies are loaded by calling the RegisterStrategy method in the hotload package.
This is the same pattern the database/sql package uses for loading drivers. The strategy
implements the Watch method. The context passed to the strategy should be used to shut
down any code watching the passed pth. Options are taken from the hotload connection
string query parameters. The strategy doesn't have to use a real file to load the config.
Pth represents a unique string that makes sense to the strategy. For example, pth could
point to a path in etcd or a kind/id in k8s.

The hotload project ships with one hotload strategy: fsnotify.

# Force Kill

By default, the hotload driver gracefully closes connections to the underlying driver. If your application holds connections open with long-running operations, this will prevent graceful switchover to new data sources.

Adding `forceKill=true` to your DSN will cause the hotload driver to close the underlying connection manually when a 
change to the connection information is detected.


For example:
```
db, err := sql.Open("hotload", "fsnotify://postgres/tmp/myconfig.txt?forceKill=true")
```
